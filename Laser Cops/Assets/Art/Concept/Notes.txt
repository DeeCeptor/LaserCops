Added a GUI concept, would like some programmer feedback.
a) Is it feasible to do? Not too much work for the programmers to use?

b) How does the score affect gameplay? 
If it doesn't, I wouldn't bother showing it until the level ends.
Unless it's an endless level, then I've got some changes to make.

c) Do you want space at the bottom to display story/character dialogue and avatars?
Does this game even have in-game dialogue?
